EAGLE 2 Build

A viewer application for opening and viewing Cadsoft EAGLE >v6 files. 

Main goals:
-- Make the board population by hand easier. (Wizard like walkthrough the BoM highlighting the same parts on the board one-by-one).
-- Mirror
-- Command line interface for highlighting multiple nets/parts. 

Other plans:
-- Gencad support

Heavilly inspired by Teradyne Design 2 Build (D2B).
